# Configuration of model

This markdown file contains the same contents as the supplementary in the related paper. 

## Aim

The model aims to couple the 'boomerang' shape relationship between WI (weathering intensity) and fluid Li isotopes.
We then used this relationship to interprete the rising Li isotopic compositions in Devonia  period.

## Major equation
The model is constructed based on Li budget mass balance equation.

## Estimating continental weathering based on the work by Joshua West

## Constructing the bommerang curve

## Monte-Carlo simulation
