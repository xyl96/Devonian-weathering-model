# Devonian-weathering-model
Main model is to run the Li monte-carlo box model to solve Devonian d7Li rise problem. 
5 xlsx files that would be used in this model were also uploaded. 
This code needs Matlab 2020+ and ~5s to run.

Details of the model configuration is presented in the associated and will be updated.

destruction-regeneration cycle code is not involed in this paper but open for discussion with any people interested in it!! (That's why I put it here hahac).
